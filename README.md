# Farming-Simulator
Thank you view assessing our Farming Simulator game!

1. Folder 'Admin' contains UML Class Diagram, UML Use Case Diagram, and the test coverage statistics.
2. Folder 'JavaDoc' of course contains all our JavaDoc.
3. Folder 'Farming Simulator' contains the source code of the game.

To install the program using source code, create a new empty Java project into the workspace (File->New->Java Project). Then right click on the source folder and choose Import...->General->File system then choose the 'FarmingSimulator' folder, and it will make a copy of those files. To run this program, (preferably) navigate to the GameEnvironment class and and click the eclipse 'play' button!

To open the jar file simply open a terminal window in the folder containing the jar file and enter
"java -jar sbh94_rea54_FarmingSimulator.jar"

Hope you like our game!
